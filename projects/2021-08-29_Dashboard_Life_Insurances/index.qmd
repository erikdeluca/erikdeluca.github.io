This project introduces a Shiny app developed in R, originally crafted in 2020 for a university exam to manage and visualize a homogeneous life insurance portfolio. 

The app allows users to manipulate parameters such as age, premium rates, and mortality tables, providing insights into portfolio performance and risk management. 

In 2023, the project underwent enhancements with improved graphics and function optimization. 
Further developments in 2025 saw its integration into a comprehensive dashboard using Quarto and Shiny, enriching the user experience and interaction. 

<!-- While still in development, the app is a valuable educational tool, currently available only in Italian, with plans to broaden its accessibility and features in future updates. -->

<!-- # Motivation -->

<!-- It doesn't get much better than playing around with data that mean a lot to you. For me, that's my Strava data (yes, I do recognize that that might sound a bit silly) -- I'm fortunate enough to have near-immediate access to some of the greatest hiking trails around (yes, I also recognize that I'm totally biased), and spending my free time romping around our local mountains has been so important for my mental health. *So,* when I was ready to do my first real deep-dive into learning how to build Shiny apps and dashboards, I knew these were the data I needed to use. -->

<!-- # What's on the dashboard? -->

<!-- This is very much an ongoing work in-progress, but the first version included a "Gear Garage" for tracking mileage on my hiking boots and bike, an activity heat map of all recorded hikes, bike rides, and walks, visualizations for exploring activity distance and elevation gain, and an interactive table of the raw data. -->

<!-- There are many more visualizations and features I'd love to add (but have been severely lacking the time to do so). I also still manually retrieve new activities using the Strava API via the [`{rStrava}` package](https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava), but I hope to automate this in the next version. Stay tuned! -->
