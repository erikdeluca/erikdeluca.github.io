This project involves a comprehensive statistical analysis of urban waste data from the municipalities in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, conducted as part of a university exam in Computational Statistics and Multivariate Models.

The analysis began with data cleaning in R, followed by a detailed statistical examination using SAS. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, including correlation matrix calculations and both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering analyses. A subsequent PCA was conducted to assess the representativeness of the clustering, with clusters visually represented on the first two principal components.

The integration of Quarto documents provides a clear presentation of the methodology and results. The entire analysis and documentation are in Italian, offering insights into waste management practices and patterns across the region.
