## Overview

This article provides an overview of the technical project I completed as part of a biostatistician interview process. The assignment involved analyzing an oncology dataset using R, with the objective of demonstrating statistical and analytical skills through a series of exercises. Although I did not secure the position, the feedback received has been invaluable for my professional growth in the field of clinical trial statistics.

## Project Description

### Dataset

The dataset provided for the project focused on lung cancer patients, with `SurvTime` as the primary response variable, representing survival time in days. Key covariates included:

- `Cell`: Type of cancer cell
- `Therapy`: Type of therapy (standard or test)
- `Prior`: Prior therapy status (0 for no, 10 for yes)
- `Age`: Age in years
- `DiagTime`: Time in months from diagnosis to trial entry
- `Kps`: Performance status

A censoring indicator variable was also included to distinguish between censored and event times. The dataset required transformation and preparation for analysis, aligning with clinical research standards.

### Exercises and Analysis

The project required solving six exercises, each designed to assess different analytical skills:

1. **Maximum Survival Time for Adeno Cell Type:** Identifying the longest survival time for the adeno cell type.
2. **Average Age of Subjects:** Calculating the mean age of study participants.
3. **Cell Type Frequency:** Determining which cell type appeared most frequently.
4. **Descriptive Statistics:** Generating descriptive statistics for all numeric variables.
5. **Survival Analysis:** Performing survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression.
6. **Multivariable Analysis:** Analyzing the effect of age on hazard ratios across different cancerous cells.

### Methodology and Tools

The analysis involved utilizing a variety of R packages for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, including `tidyverse`, `survival`, and `ggsurvfit`. The project was presented using `revealjs` for interactive slides, showcasing the statistical findings and interpretations.
