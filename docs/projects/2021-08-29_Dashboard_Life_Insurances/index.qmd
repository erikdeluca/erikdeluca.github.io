This project introduces a Shiny app developed in R, originally crafted in 2020 for a university exam to manage and visualize a homogeneous life insurance portfolio. 

The app allows users to manipulate parameters such as age, premium rates, and mortality tables, providing insights into portfolio performance and risk management. 

In 2023, the project underwent enhancements with improved graphics and function optimization. 
Further developments in 2025 saw its integration into a comprehensive dashboard using Quarto and Shiny, enriching the user experience and interaction. 

While still in development, the app is a valuable educational tool, currently available only in Italian, with plans to broaden its accessibility and features in future updates.
