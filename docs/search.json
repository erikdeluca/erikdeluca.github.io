Mainly Inflation Reserve and Group Reserve Committee;\nTesting new Reserve Reviewing approaches in ResQ, in particular, Bootstrapping for DFMs and Stochastic Result Selection to deal with confidence intervals for the ultimate claims;\nWorking on an internal project aiming to build and disclose a new model, developed in R, in order to properly assess implicit inflation in Run-Off triangles; in collaboration with one of the companies of the Group;\nSupport in building tools to facilitate and develop day-to-day processes;\nAutomatizing core reporting processes, by bridging data flow from SAP, Excel, and Word Implementation in VBA.\n\n\n\n\nFrom August 2023 to December 2024, I was involved in national medical research where I was in charge of the statistical part. The topic was “Education in lower and upper secondary schools and support of the network of reference figures for youth for prevention of HPV and other sexually transmitted infections”.\nMy tasks were:\n\nAnalyzing surveys via R and building reports for the different geographic areas and school levels;\nBuilding reports which contained stratified frequency tables, charts, models and statistical tests;\nWriting the methodologic analysis in research papers.\n\nThe models built were GLM (generalized linear models), some of them were zero-inflated quasipoisson due to the scoring rules of the survey. The statistical tests used were:\n\nMcNemar test for detecting if there is a change between the pre and post intervention.\nKruskal-Wallis test to identify if one socio-demographic characteristic is stochasticity superior to another one. This is also confirmed by the terms of the models built.\nChi-square and proportion test to inference when the frequency of an answer is different by socio-demographic characteristics.\n\nThe project is still on the way and once it finish, I’ll upload here all my notebooks and link my papers.\n\n\n\nIt sounds rare but during my bachelor’s, I worked for almost 3 years as a teacher in a public primary school.

I was in charge of teaching subjects such as math and science to children from 6 to 11 y.o. It taught me to manage a team of about 25 people (the students), very heterogeneous. Actually, I didn’t learn only how to manage students, but also the other class teachers, as I was given the role of coordinator, handling all the bureaucratic stuff.\nIt was a really important part of my life where I learned (not only taught) a lot of soft skills about explaining hard concepts in an easy way (for the children is hard, trust me) and managing teams up to 25 people (and sometimes even parents ).

    "text": "Personal Life\n\nSport\nI think that sport is very important in the life and helps to develop strength and health. Main sports:\n\nJudo: From 4 y.o., I have done international competitions around Europe. In 2016, I went for 3 weeks for a training camp in Japan. But about Judo, I’m proud of my siblings who have achieved world results, as my brother was 3rd in the World Judo Championship and 2nd in the European Judo Championship keeping the 1st place in the Juniors (U21) ranking -66Kg.\nRun: I’m not very fast and not the best runner definitely. But I’m really proud about a personal challenge done in 2023, where I finished a trail of 57 Km without ever having ran more than 21 Km. It was quite mind-challenging.\nMy secret dream is climbing, and that is my scope for the future. Until now I have only practiced bouldering in Germany, which is a fantastic place for that., but for sure one of my purposes for 2025 is finding my new place for bouldering.\n\n\n\nTravel\nI could be boring on this point but it is the truth. I think that post-COVID most people changed their habits and I wasn’t the exception. I’ve been to 20 countries, but some of them have been important for me:\n\nColombia: Follow my love and discover another one. That is the magic about travelling. I’ve lived for 3 months around this amazing country really different from what I expected.\nMalaga (Spain): I’m sure that everyone who has done an exchange program (e.g. Erasmus) can agree with me, I Ieft a piece of my heart.\nSweden: It took place in my first Erasmus project and helped me to fight my fear for English, besides that I got the chance of meeting people from around Europe full of energy and positivity.\nMarocco: I’ve been twice but why talking about the easy time with a touristic tour? Well, my girlfriend and I decided to take a random flight to the most unknown city, Nador, and what an adventure with no data and no local language during Ramadan. It has been a full immersion in the Arabic culture.\nHouston (USA): I went to a wedding and I had the opportunity to live as a Texan for one week.\n\n\n\nBeer\nI want to talk about the real beer: the craft one. I’m a nerd about craft beer, I brew my beer since 10 years ago and I use the BIAP method (Brew In A Pot). I love this hobby because it is a mix of creativity, science, and DIY. But I don’t only make it, I also taste it and as a good statistician, I record each one on Untapped!"

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, including correlation matrix calculations and both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering analyses. A subsequent PCA was conducted to assess the representativeness of the clustering, with clusters visually represented on the first two principal components.\nThe integration of Quarto documents provides a clear presentation of the methodology and results.
