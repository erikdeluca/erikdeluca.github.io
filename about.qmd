## Experience

Here is a resume of my studing and working eperiences.

## Working

Since I started the master I finally started to work for jobs related to my field of studies. Before, I worked in really different fields.

#### Actuary - Internship

I just came back from Munich (Germany) where I completed my internship at Allianz, one of the world's leading insurance and financial services providers. I've worked for 6 months at Allianz SE, the holding company of Allianz Group, in the H2 department, related to the finance processes. More accurately, I worked in the Group Actuarial Non-Life team, responsible for the Actuarial Function of the company which is the team in charge of risk assessment, financial modeling, regulatory compliance, and strategic planning.

In my case, I'm dedicated on:

-   Contributing to some of the team's reporting products. Mainly Inflation Reserve and
    Group Reserve Committee;

-   Testing new Reserve Reviewing approaches in ResQ, in particular, Bootstrapping for DFMs
    and Stochastic Result Selection to deal with confidence intervals for the ultimate claims;

-   Working on an internal project aiming to build and disclose a new model, developed in R,
    in order to properly assess implicit inflation in Run-Off triangles; in collaboration with one of
    the companies of the Group;

-   Support in building tools to facilitate and develop day-to-day processes;

-   Automatizing core reporting processes, by bridging data flow from SAP, Excel, and Word
    Implementation in VBA.

#### Biostatistician

From August 2023 to December 2024, I was involved in national medical research where I was in charge of the statistical part. The topic was *"Education in lower and upper secondary schools and support of the network of reference figures for youth for prevention of HPV and other sexually transmitted infections".*

My tasks were:

-   Analyzing surveys via R and building reports for the different geographic areas and school levels;

-   The reports contain stratified frequency tables, charts, models and statistical tests;

-   Writing the methodologic analysis in research papers.

The models built were GLM (generalized linear models), some of them were zero-inflated quasipoisson due to the scoring rules of the survey. The statistical tests used were:

-   McNemar test for detecting if there is a change between the pre and post intervention.

-   Kruskal-Wallis test to identify if one socio-demographic characteristic is stochasticity superior to another one. This is also confirmed by the terms of the models built.

-   Chi-square and proportion test to inference when the frequency of an answer is different by socio-demographic characteristics.

The project is still on the way and when it is finished, I'll upload here all my notebooks and link my papers.

#### Teacher

It sounds rare but during my bachelor's, I worked for almost 3 years as a teacher in a public primary school. I started during the pandemic era when there was a really big lack of teachers and I took the opportunity.

It has been a big challenge for me I was charged to grow up and teach subjects such as math and science to children from 6 to 11 y.o. It taught me to manage a team of 25 people (the students), really homogeneous and different not only managing students given that I was also the coordinator, the person charged with managing the other class teacher, managing all the bureaucratic staff.

It has been a really important part of my life where I learned (not only taught) a lot of soft skills about explaining hard concepts in an easy way (for the children are hard, trust me) and managing teams of up to 25 people (and related parents hahaha). In the meanwhile, I continued my studies so strategic planning of my life was the real key to success.

### Study

Here is a short overall about my studies:

-   Master's degree in Statistics and Actuarial Science with a curriculum in Data Science for Finance and Insurance at the University of Trieste. (Currently enrolled)

-   Erasmus, during my master, at the University of Malaga (Spain) where the classes were in Spanish.

-   Bachelor's degree in Statistics and IT for Business, Finance, and Insurance, my thesis was focused on decisional tree models applied to the brewery industry.

So, my fields of study are mainly statistics, data science, actuarial science, IT, and finance.

## Personal Life

### Sport

I think that sport is really important in my own life and helps to develop strength and health. Main sports:

-   Judo: From I was 4 y.o., I did international competitions around Europe. In 2016, I went for 3 weeks for a training camp in Japan. But about Judo, I'm proud of my siblings who have world results, as my brother was 3rd in the [World Judo Championship](https://www.ijf.org/judoka/50950) and 2nd in the European Judo Championship keeping the 1st place in the Juniors (U21) ranking -66Kg.

-   Run: I'm not very fast and not constant in the training. But I'm really proud about a personal challenge done in 2023, where I finished a trail of 57 Km without ever run more than 21 Km. It has been really mind-challenging.

-   My secret dream is climbing, and that is my scope for the future. Until now I have only practiced bouldering, where Germany has been fantastic at that.

### Travel

I could be boring on that point but it is. I think that post-COVID most people changed their habits and for me has been the same. I've been to 20 countries but I think that some of them have been important for me:

-   Colombia: Follow my love and discover another one. That it's been. I've lived for 3 months around this amazing country really different from what I expected.

-   Malaga (Spain): Everyone who has done an exchange program (e.g. Erasmus) could agree with me, I gave a piece of my heart.

-   Sweden: I took place in my first Erasmus project and helped me to fight my afraid for English. More than know people from around Europe and not with full of energy and positivity.

-   Marocco: I've been 2 times but why talk about the easy time with a touristic tour? Well, my girlfriend and I decided to take a random flight to a random city, Nador, and what adventure with no data and no language during Ramadan. It has been a full immersion in the Arabic culture.

-   Houston (USA): I went to a wedding and I had the opportunity to live as a Texan for one week.

### Beer

I'm not an alcoholic and I hate industrial beer. I want to talk about the craft one. I'm a nerd about craft beer, I brew my beer for 10 years and I use the BIAP method (Brew In A Pot). I love this hobby because it is a mix of creativity, science, and DIY. But I don't only make it, I also taste it and as a good statistician, I record each one on [Untapped](https://untappd.com/user/Erikdeluca)!
