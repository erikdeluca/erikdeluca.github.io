On May 26th, I participated as a speaker at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) in Rome during the event “Education, Prevention, and Health: How Schools Can Promote Adolescent Health and Prevent HPV and STIs.”

I presented pre- and post-intervention results from the ESPRIT project, focusing on knowledge and attitudes regarding HPV and vaccination among secondary school students. The data highlight several areas for improvement in adolescent sexual health education and prevention.

Thanks to all collaborators and event organizers.
