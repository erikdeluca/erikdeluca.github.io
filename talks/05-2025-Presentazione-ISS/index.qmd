## Presentation at ISS

On May 26, 2025, I took part as a speaker at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) in Rome, during the event “Education, Prevention, and Health: How Schools Can Promote Adolescent Health and Prevent HPV and STIs.”

I presented findings from the ESPRIT project, which evaluated knowledge and attitudes towards HPV and vaccination among secondary school students in three Italian regions. The results highlighted ongoing challenges and areas for improvement in sexual health education and prevention strategies.

## Key Points

Sexually transmitted infections, including HPV, continue to be a significant public health topic for adolescents. The data collected show notable gaps in awareness and vaccination coverage, underlining the importance of further educational interventions in school settings.
